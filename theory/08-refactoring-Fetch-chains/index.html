<p>The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that
resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. You can also optionally pass in an init
options object as the second argument (see Request).</p>

    <h4>Differences from AJAX</h4>
    <p>The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in three main ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500.
            Instead,
            it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if
            anything
            prevented the request from completing.</li>
        <li>fetch() won't receive cross-site cookies. You can’t establish a cross site session using fetch(). Set-Cookie
            headers
            from other sites are silently ignored.</li>
        <li>fetch() won’t send cookies, unless you set the credentials init option.
            Since Aug 25, 2017: The spec changed the default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since
            61.0b13.)</li>
    </ol>
